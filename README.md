# Vulnerability Taxonomy CWE Homework

## Chosen CWE: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

- **CWE Number:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
- **Explanation:** CWE-79, commonly referred to as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), occurs when an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to various attacks such as session hijacking, data theft, and website defacement.

## Well-Formed CPE: 

- `cpe:/a:sgyamf_vulnerable_code:1.0.0`
  - `cpe`: Common Platform Enumeration prefix.
  - `a`: Part, representing the application.
  - `sgyamf_vulnerable_code`: Vendor name and product name (replace with actual names if applicable).
  - `1.0.0`: Version number following Semantic Versioning 2.0.

## Inclusion in Top 10 KEV List: 

- Yes, CWE-79 is in the top 10 KEV list. Despite being ranked second in the overall CWE top 25, it remains a critical vulnerability due to its prevalence and the severe consequences it can have for web applications and users.

## Severity of the Weakness: 

- The severity of CWE-79 is high because it enables attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a victim's web session, leading to various forms of attacks including data theft, session hijacking, and website defacement. Its presence in the top 10 KEV list underscores its significance as a security weakness that requires immediate attention from developers and organizations.

## Personal Experience: 

- In a previous project, I encountered CWE-79 in a web application where user input was not properly sanitized before being displayed on web pages. This oversight allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts, leading to potential security breaches and compromised user data.

## Mitigation: 

- To prevent CWE-79, developers should implement proper input validation and output encoding. Sanitizing user input by removing or encoding any HTML or JavaScript tags before displaying it on web pages can effectively mitigate XSS vulnerabilities. Additionally, using security libraries and frameworks that handle input validation and output encoding automatically, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), can further enhance the security of web applications.
